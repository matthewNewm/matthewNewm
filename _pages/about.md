**Hi** ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Matthew Newman, a musician, production specialist, and creative storyteller dedicated to using my gifts to glorify God and serve others. Whether behind a soundboard, building LED walls, or playing the violin, I thrive on blending artistry with technical expertise to create meaningful, impactful experiences that allow others to focus on the only one that matters, Him.  

Through my work in para-church ministries and the church, Iâ€™ve seen how creativity can inspire, connect, and transform lives. My passion lies in crafting environments where people can worship God free from distractions, ensuring production serves as an invisible support that enhances, rather than detracts from, their focus on Him.  

**I am guided by several core beliefs:**

### Purposeful Expression  
I believe creativity is a powerful tool to communicate timeless truths. Through music, storytelling, and production, I aim to present the message of Godâ€™s love, hope, and redemption in ways that are fresh, relevant, and transformative.  

### Collaborative Creativity  
I value the collaborative process of ministry and production, where individuals bring their unique God-given gifts to serve Him. Whether itâ€™s a church service or an outreach event, I strive to create an environment that encourages others to contribute meaningfully and work together in honoring God.

### Seamless Worship Environments  
True worship happens when people can fully focus on God without distractions. My goal is to ensure all technical elementsâ€”lighting, sound, visuals, and moreâ€”blend seamlessly into the background. When done well, production becomes invisible, creating a distraction-free atmosphere where worshipers can connect with God in meaningful and undisturbed ways.  

### Authentic Worship  
Worship is about authenticity, and I strive to create spaces where people can encounter God in genuine and meaningful ways. Whether through sound engineering, visual elements, or live music, my goal is to inspire reverence, awe, and intimacy in worship, pointing hearts toward Christ.  

### Community Engagement  
I believe the creative arts are a bridge between the church and the world. Whether working in production, serving at CIY, or sharing in my local church, I seek to use my talents to engage with the broader community, building connections that reflect Godâ€™s love and grace.  

### Stewardship of Gifts  
Creativity is a gift from God, and I take seriously the responsibility to steward it well. By continually growing and refining my skills in music, production, and storytelling, I aim to honor Him and serve others with excellence and integrity in every project.  

Through these guiding principles, I strive to contribute to the spiritual growth and cultural vitality of the communities I serve. By anchoring my work in faith and collaboration, I hope to inspire others to encounter the beauty and truth of Godâ€™s love through the creative arts while ensuring production remains a supportive and unnoticed foundation for worship.
